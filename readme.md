## Evaluation Criteria

We're not talking attendance, but we might give a pop quiz to strike fear into your heart.
The majority of your grade will come from class assignments and projects.

Grading Criteria:
  * 60% - The assignment meets the specs provided
  * 10% - Your communication and problem solving to get the assignment done and learn the material
    * Github issues
    * In class participation
    * Helping other classmates on a Github issue
  * 30% - Our subjective assessment of how maintainable your code is:
    * Does it follow the conventions that we've discussed in class?
    * Is the code in the right place?
    * Are there tests that would help someone understand and work on your project?
    * Can we easily follow your process through git history?
  * Possible in-class quizzes will be added in
  * If you do a great job helping someone on a Github issue we're likely to give you a bonus


### Troubleshooting

If you get stuck on an assignment, add a [Github Issue](https://github.com/gaslight/nku/issues)
to the [NKU class repo](https://github.com/gaslight/nku/issues). Please browse other issues before
creating a new one in case someone has already asked your question. Also, please feel free to
comment on any open issues.
