# Shift Scheduler App

The purpose of this app is to managing scheduling of shifts for a restaurant or store.
The app has two main stakeholders:

1. **Managers** create shifts that need to be filled
2. **Employees** select shifts they want to work

```
As a manager
I want to create shifts for my employees
So that my restaurant can function
```

```
As an employee
I want to select shifts that I want to work
So that I can work the shifts I want
```
